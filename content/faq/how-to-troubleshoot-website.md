### How to find info from web developer tools? 
_Note:_ The outlook of web developer tools may differ by browser, instructions should still apply for most of them.
1. On most browsers you can open web developer tools by pressing "Ctrl + Shift + i" or "Option + Shift + j". (Optionally click 3-dot menu in the top-right corner and choose "More" --> "Developer tools", this may vary slightly for each browser)   
1. For better readability, move developer tools next to the browser or its own window, by clicking "3-dot menu" in the top-right corner of the developer tools and choosing "Dock to right".

1. While developer tools are open, reload the page and reproduce the issue.  
1. Near the top, in the developer tool window, you can see row of tabs. Take screenshot of the output in "console" and "network" tabs. (Some errors/warnings here are normal)  
If you have issue with the video player or with other content delivery, filter output of the network tab by "lbryplayer".
