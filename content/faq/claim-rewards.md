_On the left, navigating to Rewards in LBRY Desktop and Odysee.com. On the right, navigating to Rewards on LBRY Android._

You can find the rewards section under the Account menu > Rewards. On Android, click or slide out the menu, and then select Rewards. [Click here to navigate directly to your app](https://open.lbry.com/?rewards).

In addition to the one-time rewards, we have a daily reward for watching content you love on LBRY - so make sure to check back often to keep earning!

LBC rewards can be used to buy content on the LBRY network, to support your favorite creators, or to publish yourself. Tipping creators also helps creators become discovered on LBRY by boosting their relevance in results.
