title: Blockchain Engineer

This position involves working directly on the LBRY [blockchain](https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd) using C++ and Go. You would be
responsible for anticipating LBRY's blockchain needs (scaling, features, ecosystem integration), understanding the tradeoffs between
different ways to meet those needs, and designing and implementing your chosen solution.

Requirements:

- competence with cryptography, security, and networks
- blockchain development experience (preferably with Bitcoin or similar codebases)
- understanding of the blockchain ecosystem and history (mining, ASICs, exchanges, major design decisions, etc)

Blockchain work can be like being a goalkeeper: good work goes under-appreciated, but mistakes are catastrophic.
It's helpful to have a mindset that succeeds in the face of these incentives.
